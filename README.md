# Neutral_Network

In disciplines such as pattern recognition and game play, an artificial neural network
(ANN) blends biological principles with modern statistical techniques to solve complicated
problems. There are several methods in which ANNs might implement the essential concept of
neuron analogues; in this report, we will build an artificial neural network from scratch and train
it to a loan dataset to see if we can duplicate some of foundations of neural networks. We'll see
whether the MSE of the neural network function and the programmed artificial neural network
are comparable. The programmed ANN is a collection of multiple mathematical functions
derived from Neurons, Weights, Backpropagation, and learning rate; the functions in the model
have certain limits; for example, it can only train models with two hidden layers and can only
utilize the sigmoid activation function. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate how to apply
a combination of mathematical functions to construct an ANN model capable of forecasting
output parameters and aiding in the best selection of machining parameters for process planning
and optimization, in this case loan data. The ANN model did not perform well compared to the
in-built function NeuralNet().
